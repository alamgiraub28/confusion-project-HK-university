                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Started in 2010, Ristorante con Fusion quickly established itself as a culinary icon par excellence
                    in Hong Kong. With its unique brand of world fusion cuisine that can be found nowhere else, it
                    enjoys patronage from the A-list clientele in Hong Kong. Featuring four of the best three-star
                    Michelin chefs in the world, you never know what will arrive on your plate the next time you visit
                    us.</p>
                <p>The restaurant traces its humble beginnings to <em>The Frying Pan</em>, a successful chain started by
                    our CEO, Mr. Peter Pan, that featured for the first time the world's best cuisines in a pan.</p>
